<h4 id="Time-to-photograph"><a href="#Time-to-photograph" class="headerlink" title="Time to photograph"></a>Time to photograph</h4><p>Set in 1986, the story begins with an aspiring folklorist, Mafuyu Hinasaki, decides one night to investigate the Himuro Mansion, a place that is said to be haunted, in search of renowned folklorist Junsei Takamine. He brings with him a family heirloom, a special camera that has the power to “expose things the normal eyes can’t see”. Mafuyu enters the mansion and discovers that the ghosts of those who have perished in the mansion are roaming the empty halls. After fending off a violent ghost and seeing the power of the camera for himself, Mafuyu decides to continue his search. As he attempts to return to the entrance hall of the mansion, however, a dark presence surrounds him, and Mafuyu’s fate is unknown.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Mafuyu’s sister, Miku, arrives before the mansion. Fearing the worst may have happened to her brother, she takes it upon herself to enter the mansion and find him. Inside she finds the camera that Mafuyu brought with him, and, continuing his investigation, finds out the truth about the folklorist who went missing. Takamine came to the mansion to document the grisly events that occurred there long ago. In his progress, he uncovers the mysterious Strangling Ritual that took place in the mansion, but before he and his assistants could leave the haunted grounds, they were set upon by the spirits that were killed in the aftermath of the failed ritual. Miku continues deeper into the mansion, determined to find the truth and her missing brother. The story gets worse and worse by every room Miku enters, when later on she finds out that the Shrine Maiden (who is dead) looks for Mafuyu too.</p>
